<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm a junior developer, willing to learn and help others in the way of this journey, I like to solve problems and create things from scratch.</p>

<p>I love tech in general, I love spending time in the computer learning, I love digital marketing, I love drones, I like to stay connected.</p>

<p>If you get to know me, you will find a friend who you can relied on, somebody who likes to work as a team .</p>

<p>Something I feel proud is my ecommerce website, where I sell tech gear.</p>
